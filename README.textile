This project is an agroupation of exercises for some subjects in "my degree":http://eps.uib.es/est_estudi.php?idest=3.

h2. so (Operating Systems)

The items in this exercise are:

* 1 agent process
* 1 writer process
* 2 server process
* 500 client process

* 2 message queues
* "Semaphores":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_%28programming%29

* 1 data file with 15.000 entries plus one more field to store the number of checks made by the writer.
** Each entry in the data file has 1 field:
*** Value

* 1 shared memory with 15.000 entries
** Each entry in the shared memory zone will have 2 values
*** Value
*** Dirty (boolean flag)

* 1 writer log file

Initially all values are set to 0 (the dirty flag too). Clients comunicate with the servers (only one server attends a request) trought the message queues
in order to read or modify an entry (in the shared memory zone). If a server receives a write operation it stores the new value and sets its dirty flag to 1.

Periodically, the shared memory data is stored into a binary file by the writer process.

Any memory access (on the shared memory zone or the binary file) should be managed with semaphores ("Readers-writers problem":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers-writers_problem)


h2. bbdd (Data Bases)

It consists on making a simple database design and a PHP application for managing a
private messaging area, which will contain users and departments, manage diferent
user privileges and hability to send messages tu single users or departments (user groups)
